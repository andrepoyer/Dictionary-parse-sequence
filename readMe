This program frist sets up the file path for the input dictionary 
file and the output files (Sequence.txt and Words.txt).

It then defines an expression to match valid word charathers using 
the "re" library (letters only), and a function to extract unique 
sequences of four letter from a word. 

The program reads through the dictionary file line by line, extracting
on each line the unique sequences of 4 letters. He then grabs these
four letters and compare them with the existing lists for unique and
nonunique sequences. If a sequence is found to be nonunique it is 
removed from the unique set and it's corresponding word is also removed
from the words dictionary. If a sequence is found to be unique it is
added to the unique set and it's corresponding word is added to the
dictionary as well. 

At the end the program writes the sorted unique sequences to the sequences
file, and writes the corresponding words to the words file in the same order.

Observations:
###########################
To run the program you just need a file ".txt" with words in it. The file needs
to be on the same directory of the program and after that you just have to run 
the program and the output will be two new files "sequences.txt" and "words.txt"

You can replace the dictionary file just need to use the same name for it or
adjust the code to your file's name on line 4.

You need Python on your computer to run this program but you can use Google Colab 
Research with no need to install Python.
